*Author: "Patrick Hunt":http://people.apache.org/~phunt/* (follow me on "twitter":http://twitter.com/phunt)

h2. Summary

"This project":http://github.com/phunt/zk-txnlog-tools for examining a "ZooKeeper server":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/ transaction log. Transaction logs are output by the server to persist data (znode) changes, not to be confused with the log4j error/debug logs.

h3. What's Apache ZooKeeper?

From the "official site":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/: "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs.
